# Learning C# by Brackeys

This repo contains simple C# programs I built while following Brackeys’ “7-part guide to learning to code in C#”.

## Contents

- A collection of small C# projects and code samples covering foundational programming concepts.
- Organized by lesson or topic (e.g., variables, conditionals, loops, classes).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skipajenkins/Learning-C-by-Brackeys.git
   cd Learning-C-by-Brackeys
Open the relevant folder in your IDE or code editor (e.g., Visual Studio, VS Code).

Run the C# files—these are standalone examples, typically .cs files you can compile via:

bash
Copy code
dotnet run <filename>.cs
